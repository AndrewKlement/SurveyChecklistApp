# Applications 
For surveying industrial equipment, ships, and other assets.

# Workflow
- First, the owner will create a checklist template that specify all location or equipment that needs to be surveyed
- Second, the owner will share a .chklst to the surveyor and then the surveyor will use the checklist for surveying purposes
- Third, the surveyor will send a report to the owner in PDF format
- Fourth, if the survey report still needs a follow up report than surveyor could use the follow up feature to complete the previous survey
